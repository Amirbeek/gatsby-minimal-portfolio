My name is Amir Shomuroodv. I am a student software developer with a passion for building intuitive and impactful applications. I believe that great design and attention to detail are what make a product stand out.

I have led a team of students as a Developer and Project Lead to create the <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/216384021/Flight-Booking-System" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Brunel Flight System</u></a>, an interactive flight booking platform with real-time maps and in-flight retail, as well as <a href="https://github.com/Amirbeek/Nutri-Book" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Nutri-Book</u></a>, a recipe-sharing platform that helps users discover, create, and manage recipes with allergy-friendly features and secure authentication.

I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Science with a specialization in AI and Data Science at Brunel University London.
