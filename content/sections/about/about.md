My name is Amirbek Shomurodov. I am a student software developer. I believe in design quality and always pay attention to details because that's what makes a great product.

At Brunel University, I led a team to create  <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u> Brunel Flight System</u></a>. This project, realized through the collective effort of talented peers, introduced an innovative flight booking experience. We integrated interactive maps and diverse retail options directly within the system, offering a unified solution that simplifies and enhances both travel and shopping for users.
Using theme composition, you can easily customize the CSS theme to your own preferences - e.g. change colors, fonts, etc.

I am currently pursuing an Bachelor degree in Computer Science with a specialization in AI and Data Science at Brunel University London
